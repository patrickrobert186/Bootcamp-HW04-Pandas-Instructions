Pandas Homework for unit 4
I am still struggling to keep up.  This homework like the last one is not very good.  I managed to get through parts of the of the homework, but I had problems with concantenation of the first three csv files.  I think I need to fix the data types of the S&P 500 data but I do not know how.  Also I did not used the sorting function which means that even when using the fuctions correctly I will not get the correct answers.  Also I think I did not calcualte the pct change fucntion correctly.
